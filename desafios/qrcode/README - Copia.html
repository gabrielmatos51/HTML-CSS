        <h1> Frontend Mentor - QR code component</h1>
        
        <h2>![Design preview for the QR code component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)</h2>
        
        <h3> Welcome! ðŸ‘‹</h3>
        
        <h4>Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.</h4>
        
        <p>[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.</p>
        
        <p>To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.</p>
        
        <h2> The challenge</h2>
        
        <p>
        Your challenge is to build out this QR code component and get it looking as close to the design as possible. <br>
        
        You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go. <br>
        
        Want some support on the challenge? [Join our Slack community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/slack) and ask questions in the **#help** channel.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Where to find everything</h2>
        
        <p>
        Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. <br>
        
        The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. <br>
        
        If you would like the design files (we provide Sketch & Figma versions) to inspect the design in more detail, you can [subscribe as a PRO member](https://www.frontendmentor.io/pro). <br>
        
        You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized. <br>
        
        There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.
        </p>
        
        <h2> Building your project</h2>
        
        <h3>Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:</h3>
        
        <ol class=" list">
        <li> Initialize your project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Creating a repo will make it easier to share your code with the community if you need help. If you're not sure how to do this, [have a read-through of this Try Git resource](https://try.github.io/).</li> <br>
        <li> Configure your repository to publish your code to a web address. This will also be useful if you need some help during a challenge as you can share the URL for your project with your repo URL. There are a number of ways to do this, and we provide some recommendations below.</li><br>
        <li> Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.</li><br>
        <li> Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.</li>
        <li> Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.</li><br>
        <li> Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.</li><br>
        </ol>
        
        <h2> Deploying your project</h2>
        
        <h3>As mentioned above, there are many ways to host your project for free. Our recommend hosts are:</h3>
        
        <ul class=" list">
        <li> [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)</li>
        <li>[Vercel](https://vercel.com/)</li>
            <li>[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>You can host your site using one of these solutions or any of our other trusted providers. [Read more about our recommended and trusted hosts](https://medium.com/frontend-mentor/frontend-mentor-trusted-hosting-providers-bf000dfebe).</p>
        
        <h2> Create a custom `README.md`</h2>
        
        <p>
        We strongly recommend overwriting this `README.md` with a custom one. We've provided a template inside the [`README-template.md`](./README-template.md) file in this starter code. <br>
        
        The template provides a guide for what to add. A custom `README` will help you explain your project and reflect on your learnings. Please feel free to edit our template as much as you like.<br>
        
        Once you've added your information to the template, delete this file and rename the `README-template.md` file to `README.md`. That will make it show up as your repository's README file.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Submitting your solution</h2>
